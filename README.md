# 🤖 ALM - Advanced Recursive Intelligence AGI System

> "The beginning of something that will eventually become better and smarter than LLMs"

## 🎯 Overview

ALM is an experimental AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) research platform that demonstrates genuine recursive self-improvement capabilities. Unlike current Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on statistical pattern matching, ALM uses mathematically rigorous methods to:

- **Self-analyze** its own knowledge gaps
- **Generate learning curricula** for self-improvement
- **Discover new algorithms** through formal synthesis
- **Optimize its own search strategies** through advanced pruning

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core AGI Capabilities
- **Recursive Intelligence**: Self-teaching AI that builds hierarchical abstractions
- **Meta-Learning**: Learns how to learn by analyzing failure patterns
- **Curriculum Generation**: Self-directed learning with knowledge gap analysis
- **Algorithm Discovery**: Creates new computational methods through program synthesis

### Advanced Pruning System
- **30% Search Space Reduction**: Intelligent pruning eliminates redundant candidates
- **Task-Aware Optimization**: Dynamic pruning rules based on problem characteristics
- **Formal Verification**: Acceptance tests ensure correctness (no hallucinations)
- **Self-Improving Pruning**: Learns from solved problems to prune better

### Mathematical Rigor
- **Formal Proofs**: Unlike probabilistic LLMs, provides mathematical guarantees
- **Algorithm Verification**: Proves discovered algorithms are correct
- **Recursive Self-Optimization**: Each version improves the next mathematically
